                     <h1>Sherlock</h1>
                     <p>
                        Sherlock is a crime drama television series based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes detective stories.
						Created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as 
						Doctor John Watson. Thirteen episodes have been produced, with three-part series airing in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2017, 
						and a special episode airing on 1 January 2016. The series is set in the present day, while the one-off special features 
						a Victorian period fantasy resembling the original Holmes stories. S
                     </p>
                     <br>
					 <p>
					 All of the series have been released on DVD and Blu-ray, alongside tie-in editions of selected original Conan Doyle 
					 stories and original soundtrack composed by David Arnold and Michael Price. In January 2014, the show launched its 
					 official mobile app called Sherlock: The Network.

                     <p>
                        Sherlock depicts "consulting detective" Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) solving various mysteries in
						modern-day London. Holmes is assisted by his flatmate and friend, Dr John Watson (Martin Freeman), who has 
						returned from military service in Afghanistan with the Royal Army Medical Corps. 
                     </p>
                     <br>
					 <h2>Episodes</h2>
					 <p>
					 Four series, each consisting of three episodes, have been produced. The first series was initially broadcast in July and August 
					 2010 on the BBC, later premiering on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States in October 2010. A second series 
					 of three episodes was first broadcast in the UK in January 2012, and then in the U.S. during May 2012. The third series 
					 premiered in the UK on 1 January 2014 and in the US on 19 January 2014. The series has been sold to 180 territories. 
					 </p>
					 <br>
					 <h4><b>Series 1(2010)</b></h4>
					 <p>
					The first episode, "A Study in Pink", loosely based upon the first Sherlock Holmes novel A Study in Scarlet, was written by 
					Moffat and directed by Paul McGuigan. The story depicts the introduction of Sherlock to John, and them entering a flatshare 
					at Baker Street in London, and then their investigation into a series of deaths, initially believed to be suicides. Mycroft 
					Holmes, Sherlock's older brother, played by Mark Gatiss, also appears for the first time. The episode was first broadcast 
					simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD on 25 July 2010. 
					 </p>
					 <p>
					 The second episode, "The Blind Banker", was first broadcast on 1 August 2010. Written by Stephen Thompson and directed by Euros
					 Lyn, the episode depicts Holmes being hired by an old university acquaintance to investigate a mysterious break-in at a bank 
					 in the City of London.
					 </p>
					<img src="img/studyinpink.jpg" alt="study in pink"> 
					 <p>The first series concluded with "The Great Game", first broadcast on 8 August 2010. The episode introduces the character of a
					 rchenemy James Moriarty (played by Andrew Scott) to the series, who sets Holmes deadlines to solve a series of apparently unrelated
					 cases. Written by Mark Gatiss and directed by McGuigan, "The Great Game" ends with a cliffhanger in which Sherlock and Moriarty 
					 reach a standoff involving a bomb attached to a vest removed moments earlier from Watson.</p>
					 <br>
					 <h4><b>Series 2(2012)</b></h4>
					 <p>
					 Acknowledging that 
					 "A Scandal in Bohemia", "The Hound of the Baskervilles" and "The Final Problem" are amongst the best-known Holmes stories, 
					 Gatiss explained, "We knew after having a successful first run that the natural order would be to do three of the most famous 
					 [stories]."
					 </p>
					 <br>
					 <p>
					 "A Scandal in Belgravia", written by Steven Moffat and directed by Paul McGuigan, was first broadcast on 1 January 2012. 
					 Loosely based on "A Scandal in Bohemia", the episode depicts Holmes's quest to retrieve compromising photos of a minor royal 
					 held on the camera phone of Irene Adler (Lara Pulver), a ruthless and brilliant dominatrix who also trades in classified information
					 extracted from her rich and powerful clients.
					 </p>
					 <br>
					 <p>
					 Mark Gatiss wrote "The Hounds of Baskerville", which investigates the strange activities at a military base. Aware that The Hound
					 of the Baskervilles, first published in 1902, was one of the most famous of Conan Doyle's original stories, Gatiss felt a greater 
					 responsibility to include familiar elements of the story than he does when adapting the lesser-known stories.
					 </p>
					<img src="img/sherlock2.png" alt="reichenbach fall"> 
					<p>
					The second series concluded with "The Reichenbach Fall". Steve Thompson wrote the episode, which was directed by Toby Haynes, 
					who had previously directed many of Moffat's Doctor Who episodes. First broadcast on 15 January 2012, the episode follows Moriarty's
					plot to discredit and kill Sherlock Holmes, concluding with Holmes faking his suicide.</p>
					<br>
					<h4><b>Christmas mini-episode(2013)</b></h4>
					 <p>
					 BBC One premiered a seven-minute Sherlock mini-episode over the 2013 Christmas period entitled "Many Happy Returns". 
					 The episode is available via BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button service, and BBC's YouTube channel,and acts as a prequel 
					 to the third series.
					 </p>
					 <br>
					 <p>
					 The synopsis for the episode reads "Sherlock has been gone for two years. But someone isn't quite convinced that he's dead."
					 The 'someone' turns out to be Anderson, the forensics technician from series 1 and 2 (who has now lost his job due to his 
					 obsessive conviction that the detective still lives). He had a long-standing mistrust of Sherlock, yet is now one of the few 
					 people who believes Sherlock is alive, and throughout the episode is trying to convince Lestrade. Anderson tracks him via various
					 mysterious events from Tibet to New Delhi to Germany in which he seems to be involved and points out that the incidents are getting 
					 progressively closer to London.</p>
					 <br>
					<h4><b>Series 3(2014)</b></h4>
					 <p>
					  Without revealing whether Moriarty also faked his own death at the end of series two, Moffat suggested that
					 Moriarty will not feature heavily in future series of Sherlock.
					 </p><br>
					 <p>
					 "The Empty Hearse", written by Mark Gatiss and directed by Jeremy Lovering, is the first episode of Series 3 and was first broadcast
					 on 1 January 2014. Inspired by "The Adventure of the Empty House" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the episode follows Sherlock Holmes'
					 return to London and reunion with John Watson, and their subsequent solving of an underground terrorist network.</p>
                  <br>
				  <p>In "The Sign of Three", written by Stephen Thompson, Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat,Watson and Mary Morstan get married. The
				  episode takes place during the wedding reception and the story is told through flashbacks. 
				  </p>
				  <img src="img/hislastvow.jpg" alt="his last vow"> 
				  <p>The final episode "His Last Vow" was first broadcast on 12 January 2014, on BBC One, and written by Steven Moffat, directed by 
				  Nick Hurran and is based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton". This case leads Sherlock into
				  conflict with Charles Augustus Magnussen (Lars Mikkelsen), a "terrifying" villain who was introduced as an unnamed villain in episode 
				  one.
				  </p><br>
				  <p>The third series aired in the United States on PBS over a period of three weeks, airing late January to early February 2014.
				  </p>
				  <br>
					<h4><b>Special(2016)</b></h4>
					<h5>The Abominable Bride</h5>
					<p>On 2 July 2014, it was announced there would be a special episode broadcast between the third and fourth series. 
					Filming began on 5 January 2015 and wrapped on 10 February 2015. Moffat confirmed the episode is set in 
					Victorian London, saying, "The special is its own thing. We wouldn't have done the story we're doing, and the way we're doing it,
					if we didn't have this special. It's not part of the run of three episodes. So we had this to do it … It's kind of in its own little
					bubble."
					</p>
					<img src="img/abominable.jpg" alt="abominable bride"> 
					<p>In October 2015, the title of the episode was announced as "The Abominable Bride". It was broadcast on 1 January 2016 at 
					9:00 pm local time on BBC One in the UK, and on PBS in the US.
					<br>
					<h4><b>Series 4(2017)</b></h4>
					<p>
					By October 2013, a fourth series was commissioned, with scripts planned. Moffat told The Telegraph in January 2014, 
					"we're all keen to continue," but said it had been difficult to co-ordinate the lead actors' schedules.</p>
				  <img src="img/eurus.png" alt="final problem"> 
				  <p>
				   Filming began on 4 April 2016 at Pinewood Studio Wales, and lasted until 5 August. In May 2016 it was announced that Toby 
				   Jones had been cast as a villain from Sherlock Holmes lore. The fourth series premiered on 1 January 2017, with 
				   "The Six Thatchers". The second episode "The Lying Detective" aired on 8 January 2017; the last episode "The Final Problem" 
				   aired on 15 January 2017.
